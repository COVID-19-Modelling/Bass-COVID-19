# BassCOVID19
Use Bass-SIR model to capture the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreaks


## Dependancy

- Model fitting: R2jags (including JAGS)
- Simulation: odin
- Visualisation: ggplot2


## Following our researh flow

Ps. Due to the urgency of the global issue, the codes haven't well-formulated yet. We will update it soon.


### git out project
```
git clone https://github.com/COVID-19-Modelling/Bass-COVID-19.git
```

### Model fitting, simulation, and analysis

run **Main.R** for fetching all results


## What this study is doing

### Functionalities

- Identifying exogenous and endogenous force of infection of an outbreak
- Providing epidemic curves fitting with a Bayesian-based method 
- Generating time-varying effective reproduction numbers 
- Forecasting for future scenarios
 

### Intervention analysis

What if ...?
We closed all possibiliyies which causes exogenous force of infection (Overwhelming lockdown)  


### Scenario analysis

Two types of scenario were considered:

- Decreasing recovery rate due to healthcare system dysfunctioning or economic burden
- Increasing accessible contact if bussiness and shool open in the near future
